Python Basics by Scaler learning part -1


Through this Python Basics course by Scaler, I gained a solid understanding of core programming concepts and how to apply them in real-world scenarios. Here's a quick summary of my learning journey:
- Learned how to declare variables and work with different data types like strings, integers, and booleans.
- Understood how to control program flow using if, else, and loops like for and while.
- Built reusable code using functions and explored recursion and parameter passing.
- Explored Python's built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- Got hands-on with object-oriented programming: creating classes, objects, and using inheritance.
- Discovered how to organize code using modules and packages.
- Practiced reading from and writing to files using Python's file handling techniques.
- Learned how to handle errors gracefully using try-except blocks and custom exceptions.
